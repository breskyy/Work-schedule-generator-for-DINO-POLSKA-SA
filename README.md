# Work-schedule-generator-for-DINO-POLSKA-SA

The DINO POLSKA SA work schedule generator for managers is designed to make it easier for store managers to create a work schedule for their employees using automated tools that take into account factors such as employee availability, applicable labor law regulations, employee preferences, as well as the operational needs of the store, while optimizing working time and employment costs.

The generator will allow for quick and convenient creation of graphite planners for the entire team, and after generation it will allow for easy modification of the generated schedule and adjustment to unforeseen situations, such as illness, sick leave, and will provide ongoing information on the most important things, such as: the current status of hours to be used, required overtime if the full-time hours are about to run out, or the status of hours of each employee (divided into full-time and overtime).

Everything will be presented in an accessible form to make using this generator as enjoyable as possible.

I will add new features to this project as fast as possible.
